### Editing `config.json`  
Customize the map‚Äôs behavior by modifying the `config.json` file, or utilizing `Dev Tools` by enabling the `Developer Mode` option.  

#### Basic Settings  
```jsonc
"Settings": {  
    "Page Title": "Map Name", // THIS IS THE NAME OF THE WEB PAGE.
    "Enable Grid Toggle": true, // SET TO FALSE IF YOUR MAP DOESN'T HAVE GRID ON/OFF VARIANTS.
    "Enable Reset View": true, // IF THE USER CAN RESET VIEW. TRUE IS RECOMMENDED.
    "Enable Day Time Toggle": true, // IF THE USER CAN CHANGE THE DAY TIME FOR THEM.
    "Enable Weather Toggle": true, // IF THE USER CAN CHANGE THE WEATHER FOR THEM.
    "Enable Overlays": true, // ENABLE IF YOU HAVE MAP OVERLAY FILES.
    "Enable User Tools": true, // IF THE USER CAN USE VARIOUS TOOLS LIKE DISTANCE MEASUREMENT.
    "Enable Settings": true, // IF THE USER CAN CHANGE THEIR SETTINGS. TRUE IS RECOMMENDED.
    "Developer Mode": true, // THIS IS FOR YOUR EXCLUSIVE USE, TO HELP SETTING UP THE MAP.
    "Zoom": {
        "Min": 0.8,
        "Max": 5
    },
        "Overlays": { // CONTAINS THE OVERLAY OPTIONS. SET TO FALSE THE ONES YOU DON'T HAVE.
        "Settlements": true, // IF YOU HAVE AN IMAGE OF SETTLEMENTS ONLY FOR OVERLAYING.
        "Landmarks": true, // IF YOU HAVE AN IMAGE OF LANDMARKS ONLY FOR OVERLAYING.
        "Land Routes": true, // IF YOU HAVE AN IMAGE OF LAND ROUTES ONLY FOR OVERLAYING.
        "Sea Routes": true // IF YOU HAVE AN IMAGE OF SEA ROUTES ONLY FOR OVERLAYING.
    },
        "Map Scale": { // THIS IS FOR THE DISTANCE MEASUREMENT TOOL.
        "Distance Per Map Pixel": 0.342, // HOW MANY OF [DIST. UNIT] EACH PIXEL REPRESENTS.
        "Distance Unit": "Miles" // THE UNIT MEASUREMENT TO BE DISPLAYED.
    }
}  
```  

#### Map & Overlay Paths  
```jsonc
"Maps": {  
    "Grid": "map_grid.jpg", // DEFAULT MAP IMAGE. REGARDLESS OF WHETHER IT HAS A GRID OR NOT.
    "Gridless": "map_gridless.jpg"
},  
"Overlays": {  
    "Settlements": "overlay_settlements.webp",
    "Landmarks": "overlay_landmarks.webp",
    "Land Routes": "overlay_land_routes.webp",
    "Sea Routes": "overlay_sea_routes.webp"
}  
```  
- **Example**: If your map is `assets/user/maps/fantasy_map.jpg`, set `"Grid": "fantasy_map.jpg"`.  

#### Interactive Elements  
- **Map Tooltips**: Add lore hints triggered by mouse hover.  
- **Region Music**: Assign music to specific map areas.  
```json  
"Map Tooltips": [  
    {  
        "name": "Oaklen (Village)",  
        "description": "A hub for travelers...",  
        "area": { "x": { "min": 100, "max": 200 }, "y": { "min": 50, "max": 150 } }  
    }  
],  
"Region Music": [  
    {  
        "sound path": "forest_theme.mp3",  
        "area": { "x": { "min": 300, "max": 400 }, "y": { "min": 200, "max": 300 } }  
    }  
]  
```  

#### Dev Tools
Set `"Developer Mode": true` to enable several **Developer Tools** that will assist you in configuring your map. Such tools include:
- Defining Map Areas. Use this to draw Map Tooltips and Regional Sounds!
- Logging mouse coordinates in real-time. Use this for fine-tuning!

### Hosting Your Map  
1. **Local Testing**:  
   - Open `index.html` in a browser. Use a local server (e.g., Local Host, VS Code‚Äôs Live Server) to avoid CORS issues.  
2. **Host Online**:  
   - **GitHub Pages**: Fork this repo, enable GitHub Pages in your repo settings, and select the `main` branch.  
   - Your map will be live at `https://[your-username].github.io/Questifyre-Interactive-Map/`.
